# Deployment Provisioning

## Current Behavior

FlowCI can create provider deployment targets during project setup and push initial runtime env vars directly to the provider. Env var values are write-only: FlowCI sends them to Render or Vercel and stores only metadata.

## Provider Strategy

```text
vercel + flowci_managed            => vercel_ci_pushed
vercel + byo                       => vercel_ci_pushed
render + flowci_managed            => render_image_pushed
render + byo + image deploy        => render_image_pushed
render + byo + native Git build    => render_git_connected
render + existing service          => render_existing_service
```

`provider_native` and `vercel_git_connected` remain legacy/future strategy types, but normal project provisioning should not select them for new Vercel or managed Render targets.

## Managed Render

For FlowCI-managed Render targets:

1. FlowCI creates an image-backed Render service through the Render API.
2. The initial service image is `FLOWCI_RENDER_BOOTSTRAP_IMAGE`.
3. FlowCI installs deterministic per-slot GitHub Actions secrets into the generated GitHub repo.
4. The generated package workflow builds the backend Docker image, pushes it to GHCR, then calls the central `render-deploy.yml` reusable workflow.
5. The reusable workflow calls `POST /v1/services/{serviceId}/deploys` with the pushed `imageUrl`.

This avoids requiring the user to install Render's GitHub integration for managed deployments.

Required backend env vars:

```env
ENV_PROVISIONING_ENABLED=true
FLOWCI_RENDER_API_KEY=<flowci-managed-render-api-key>
FLOWCI_RENDER_OWNER_ID=<render-workspace-owner-id>
FLOWCI_RENDER_DEFAULT_REGION=singapore
FLOWCI_RENDER_DEFAULT_INSTANCE_TYPE=free
FLOWCI_RENDER_ALLOWED_INSTANCE_TYPES=free
FLOWCI_RENDER_ALLOW_PAID_MANAGED=false
FLOWCI_RENDER_MANAGED_MAX_SERVICES_PER_USER=2
FLOWCI_RENDER_BOOTSTRAP_IMAGE=ghcr.io/cicd-external-project/flowci-render-bootstrap:node-22
FLOWCI_RENDER_REGISTRY_CREDENTIAL_ID=<optional-render-registry-credential-id>
```

`FLOWCI_RENDER_REGISTRY_CREDENTIAL_ID` is needed when Render must pull private GHCR images.

## Managed Vercel

For FlowCI-managed Vercel targets:

1. FlowCI creates the Vercel project through the Vercel API.
2. The Vercel project is created without `gitRepository`.
3. FlowCI installs per-slot GitHub Actions secrets into the generated GitHub repo.
4. The generated package workflow deploys with the central `vercel-deploy.yml` reusable workflow.

This avoids requiring the user to install the Vercel GitHub App.

Required backend env vars:

```env
FLOWCI_VERCEL_TOKEN=<flowci-managed-vercel-token>
FLOWCI_VERCEL_TEAM_ID=<flowci-vercel-team-id>
FLOWCI_VERCEL_TEAM_SLUG=<optional-flowci-vercel-team-slug>
```

## GitHub Actions Secrets

For CI-pushed Vercel targets, FlowCI installs deterministic per-slot secrets:

```text
VERCEL_FRONTEND_TOKEN
VERCEL_FRONTEND_ORG_ID
VERCEL_FRONTEND_PROJECT_ID

VERCEL_BACKEND_TOKEN
VERCEL_BACKEND_ORG_ID
VERCEL_BACKEND_PROJECT_ID

VERCEL_STANDALONE_TOKEN
VERCEL_STANDALONE_ORG_ID
VERCEL_STANDALONE_PROJECT_ID
```

For Render image-pushed targets, FlowCI installs:

```text
RENDER_BACKEND_API_KEY
RENDER_BACKEND_SERVICE_ID
RENDER_BACKEND_OWNER_ID
RENDER_BACKEND_REGISTRY_CREDENTIAL_ID

RENDER_STANDALONE_API_KEY
RENDER_STANDALONE_SERVICE_ID
RENDER_STANDALONE_OWNER_ID
RENDER_STANDALONE_REGISTRY_CREDENTIAL_ID
```

Managed targets use FlowCI provider tokens. BYO targets use the user's saved provider connection token.

## Generated Workflow Contract

Generated package-stage workflows call:

```text
cicd-external-project/cicd-workflow/.github/workflows/vercel-deploy.yml@v1
cicd-external-project/cicd-workflow/.github/workflows/render-deploy.yml@v1
```

The Render reusable workflow expects:

```text
RENDER_API_KEY
RENDER_SERVICE_ID
RENDER_OWNER_ID
RENDER_REGISTRY_CREDENTIAL_ID
```

The generated workflow maps those reusable-workflow secrets from the per-slot repository secrets above.

## Cost Controls

Managed Render defaults to:

```text
service type: web_service
instance type: free
paid managed provisioning: disabled
```

Paid managed instance types require `FLOWCI_RENDER_ALLOW_PAID_MANAGED=true` and must also be listed in `FLOWCI_RENDER_ALLOWED_INSTANCE_TYPES`.

## Live Verification

After deploying backend, frontend, and central workflow to test:

1. Ensure managed Render and Vercel env vars are present in the backend deployment.
2. Create a backend project with `Managed by FlowCI` and Render.
3. Confirm a Render service was created in `FLOWCI_RENDER_OWNER_ID`.
4. Confirm the generated GitHub repo has `RENDER_BACKEND_API_KEY`, `RENDER_BACKEND_SERVICE_ID`, and `RENDER_BACKEND_OWNER_ID`.
5. Push to `test` and confirm the package workflow builds and pushes a GHCR image.
6. Confirm the central Render workflow calls the Render deploy API with `imageUrl`.
7. Create a frontend project with `Managed by FlowCI` and confirm the existing Vercel flow still works.

Use `docs/deployment-provisioning-live-smoke.md` for the full live smoke
checklist and cleanup sequence. The live smoke creates temporary GitHub, Vercel,
and Render resources and must only be run after explicit approval.
